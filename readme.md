This project is intended for users to be able to view, share and search for gifs. The website will be using an API-based integration key which will allow users to see gifs from the giphy website.
In the home page random gifs are generated for users to get an idea as to what they might be looking for. The search functionality works in the way that users will be able to search for keywords relating to the gifs they are wanting to share.
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript
